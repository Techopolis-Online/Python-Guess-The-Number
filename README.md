# Python-Guess-The-Number
Welcome to the Guess the Number game. This is a python program to teach basic python concepts. The objective is to guess the random number between 1-10. The user has only 3 guesses and after that point they will be kicked out of the application for not guessing correctly. After each guess attempt, a sound is played either telling you are  correct  or a sound for incorrect.
